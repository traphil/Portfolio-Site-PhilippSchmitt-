      <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer with a strong background in online marketing. The philosophical question “WHY” was always present and of central interest in my youth that still drives my curiosity until now. But in my adulthood, the question “HOW”
        gathered more and more my interest and occupied my mind. After several years of work experience abroad, two accomplished university studies, intercultural competencies, and foreign languages, the analytical and pragmatic question “HOW TO MAKE
        BETTER” evolved as my passion to act on a maxim and transformed into a lifelong learning approach.
      <h3>Marketing by education. Traveler by heart. UX/ UI by mindset.</h3>
      Over the past years, I made valuable life experience working as a product and marketing manager in a destination management company and several online marketing positions in the automotive and lead generation industry. During that time, I
      learned to speak and command multiple languages fluently.In my former positions, I managed several content management systems and was busy with two major data migration projects and website relaunches.<br><br>
      Improving the company’s digital presence as well as content creation and campaign management is part of my daily working habits. For me, that was a perfect moment to leave the company- centric approach and comprehend better a User Experience as
      the center of attention to intensify my career in that area. Uniting both my strategic marketing and operating creativity skills, I want to build exceptional experiences and solutions to further help and consult a user with his decisions.
      <br></br>
      For the future, I’d like to offer both my creative solutions and consulting performance skills to companies and institutions of the aforementioned disciplines.<br><br>
      <h3>Words are sweet candy, but you do prefer a savory feast?</h3>
      <p>In that case, you should take a look at my portfolio. If you can identify with my profile and see a fit at first glance, I would be very happy to intensify your impression. Let’s both find out more about a possible long-term collaboration.
